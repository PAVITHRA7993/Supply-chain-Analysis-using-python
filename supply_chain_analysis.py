# Supply chain analysis using python

Supply chain analysis is an important aspect of business operations. Python is a popular language for data analysis and visualization, and there are many libraries available to help with supply chain analysis. One such library is Pandas, which is used for data manipulation and analysis. Another library is Plotly, which is used for creating interactive visualizations.

Here is a brief outline of how you can use Python to perform supply chain analysis:

1.Collect data on the different stages of the supply chain, such as sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, sales, and customer demographics.

2.Use Pandas to clean and manipulate the data.

3.Use Plotly to create interactive visualizations that help you understand the data.

4.Analyze the data to identify areas where the supply chain can be improved.

SKU stands for Stock Keeping Units. Theyâ€™re like special codes that help companies keep track of all the different things they have for sale. Imagine you have a large toy store with lots of toys. Each toy is different and has its name and price, but when you want to know how many you have left, you need a way to identify them. So you give each toy a unique code, like a secret number only the store knows. This secret number is called SKU.
